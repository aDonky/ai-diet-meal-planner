language: English
summary: "<p>We all love a well-cooked home meal, but the choice of what to prepare\
  \ is the actual challenge — especially when you are short on time, ingredients,\
  \ or ideas of what to have. What if you had an AI sous-chef of your own? You will\
  \ develop a<strong> </strong>multi-agent AI system using FastAPI where each agent\
  \ plays a role in designing the perfect recipe depending on what you have in your\
  \ kitchen and your nutritional needs. You’ll create agents that analyze available\
  \ ingredients, filter recipes by diet type, and plan a complete step-by-step meal—\
  with structured JSON outputs from LLMs.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"https://hyperskill.org/projects/530?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card\"\
